## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Load libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

## Load data
```{r Load ENIGMA processed data}

# Load ENIGMA csv that contains age predictions, sex, dx, chronological age
enigma_final <- read_csv("/external/rprshnas01/tigrlab/scratch/csun/brainage_proj/data/processed/enigma_final.csv")

# Create condensed version of data frame containing only demographic variables
demo_vars <- c("participant", "sex", "dx", "Age", "age_prediction") # list of demographic variables
enigma_demo <- enigma_final[demo_vars]
enigma_demo

#### Load and tidy TAY clinical data ####
# full TAY clinical data
clinical_df <- read_csv("/KIMEL/tigrlab/scratch/csun/brainage_proj/data/raw/brainage_clinical_data.csv")
clinical_df

# modify the clinical data frame 'subject_id' to match 'participant' string in enigma data frames

# replace the string prefix TAY01 with sub- 
clinical_df$subject_id <- gsub("TAY01", "sub-", clinical_df$subject_id) 

# remove the two underscores surrounding CMH 
clinical_df$subject_id <- gsub("_CMH_","CMH", clinical_df$subject_id)

# rename the subject_id column heading 'participant' to match enigma data frames
clinical_df <- clinical_df %>% # need to specify where to store the new df 
  rename(participant = subject_id) 
clinical_df

```
## Calculate brain age gap
```{r Calculating brain age gap}

# Brain Age Gap = BAG = "age_prediction" - "Age"
# BAG refers to the difference between the age of individuals predicted by ENIGMA (brain age or "age_prediction") and their chronological age

# First calculate BAG for all participants and append BAG as a new column to the modified enigma data frame

# use the mutate() function to create a new variable BAG for "brain age gap"
enigma_BAG <- enigma_demo %>% mutate(BAG = age_prediction - Age) 
enigma_BAG

# check if any participants have 'NA' values for 'Age'
na_count <- sum(is.na(enigma_demo$Age))
na_count

na_count2 <- sum(is.na(enigma_final$Age))
na_count2

# check if any participants have 'NA' values for 'dx' (diagnosis)
na_count_dx <- sum(is.na(enigma_final$dx))
na_count_dx

# create a new data frame that excludes participants that are missing dx information
enigma_dx <- enigma_BAG[complete.cases(enigma_BAG$dx), ]
enigma_dx

# check if any participants have 'NA' values for 'sex' 
na_count_sex <- sum(is.na(enigma_final$sex))
na_count_sex

```
## Incorporate total disorders
These next two code chunks are both modified versions of code chunks for incorporating total disorders and ASD diagnoses from 01_centile_stats.Rmd (path: /external/rprshnas01/tigrlab/scratch/csun/BrainChart_data/notebooks/Rmd/01_centile_stats.Rmd)
```{r Add total number of disorders and ASD}

#### Append total # of disorders for all participants ####

# identify all disorder categories included in clinical data by creating a list of disorders
list_disorders <- list(colnames(clinical_df %>% select(ends_with("disorders"))))
list_disorders
# check type
class(list_disorders)
# convert list back to vector so that it can be passed through the mutate_at() function later on
list_disorders <- unlist(list_disorders, use.names=FALSE)
# check type again
class(list_disorders)


###### Finding NA values #####
# Identify categories of disorders with NA values
# find total NA values by column
sapply(clinical_df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
# source: https://www.statology.org/is-na/

# replace all "NA" values in the disorders columns with "0"
clinical_new <- clinical_df %>% 
  # replace NA values in the 12 disorder columns
  # list_disorders has been passed through the unlist() function so it is no longer a list
  mutate_at(c(list_disorders), ~replace_na(., 0)) 
# must put in the value 0 rather than the string "0" because the disorders columns are type "dbl" (numeric)
clinical_new
# Source: https://sparkbyexamples.com/r-programming/replace-na-with-empty-string-in-r-dataframe/?expand_article=1

###### Total disorders ######
# add values across each row for all the disorders and append the total as a new column to modified clinical_new data frame called 'clinical_plus'
clinical_plus <- mutate(clinical_new, total_dx = (rowSums(clinical_new[, list_disorders]))) 
clinical_plus # this data frame contains one addt'l columns with the total number of disorders summed from all 12 categories (total_dx)
# Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-two-or-multiple-dataframe-columns-in-r/

# Append the total disorders columns to enigma_BAG data frame
enigma_BAG <- merge(enigma_BAG,
                       clinical_plus[c('participant', 'total_dx')], by ='participant', all.x = TRUE)
# merge by 'participant' column so that only the total disorders for participants in enigma_BAG AND clinical_df are merged  
enigma_BAG
```
## Creating separate ASD data frames
```{r Add total number of disorders and ASD}
#### Append ASD for participants age <18 ####
# use KSADS response for participants younger than age 18
# append the "asd_info_asd_ksads
# "Yes - participant met criteria for ASD on the KSADS" 
# "No - participant did not meet criteria for ASD on the KSADS"

# Filter for all participants who do not have 'NA' for 'asd_info_asd_ksads' column
clinical_ASD <- filter(clinical_df, !is.na(asd_info_asd_ksads))
# there are 150 participants who have KSADS info, this suggests that one of the participants whose scan age was < 18 y/o does not have info for KSADS (which is why filtering for scan age < 18 returned 151 participants, whereas filtering for KSADS returned only 150)
clinical_ASD

# modify the clinical ASD data frame 'asd_info_asd_ksads' entry to be easier to interpret

# replace the long strings with "Yes" and "No" 
clinical_ASD$asd_info_asd_ksads <- gsub("Yes - participant met criteria for ASD on the KSADS", "Yes", clinical_ASD$asd_info_asd_ksads) 

clinical_ASD$asd_info_asd_ksads <- gsub("No - participant did not meet criteria for ASD on the KSADS", "No", clinical_ASD$asd_info_asd_ksads) 

# replace the "insufficient info..." string with the string "No"
clinical_ASD$asd_info_asd_ksads <- gsub("Insufficient information - Participant was sub-threshold or query for ASD on the KSADS", "No", clinical_ASD$asd_info_asd_ksads) 
  # group participants that did not have enough information for ASD diagnosis using KSADS in the No ASD group  

# rename the 'asd_info_asd_ksads' column heading to "ASD_dx"
clinical_ASD <- clinical_ASD %>% rename(ASD_dx = asd_info_asd_ksads)
clinical_ASD

# Append the ASD_dx column to enigma_BAG data frame
enigma_ASD <- merge(enigma_BAG,
                       clinical_ASD[c('participant', 'ASD_dx')], by ='participant') # take the natural join so that only participants with data in both data frames (enigma_ASD and clinical_ASD) are added to the new data frame
enigma_ASD
# enigma_ASD is a data frame that includes brain age gap (BAG), predicted age, PSS and Non-PSS diagnosis (dx), ASD diagnoses (see above for what NA means), and total number of disorders for participants who have KSADS info

# Identify if any participants from clinical_ASD data frame were not merged with enigma_BAG
anti_join(clinical_ASD, enigma_BAG)
# anti_join function from dplyr returns all rows from x without a match in y
# Source: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter-joins.html

# convert ASD_dx character to factor
enigma_ASD$ASD_dx <- as.factor(enigma_ASD$ASD_dx)
View(enigma_ASD)

# save the enigma data frame with ASD info appended as a csv
write.csv(enigma_ASD, "/KIMEL/tigrlab/scratch/csun/brainage_proj/data/processed/enigma_ASD.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
### Explanation for participants with ASD data who were not included in enigma BAG calculations
1. sub-CMH00000020 is missing data for volumes, cortical thickness, and surface area due to incomplete MRI.	
2. sub-CMH00000282 is missing data for sex assigned at birth.

The next two code chunks are modified from 01_centile_stats.Rmd (path: '/external/rprshnas01/tigrlab/scratch/csun/BrainChart_data/notebooks/Rmd/01_centile_stats.Rmd')

## Create age categories
```{r Creating a new variable for age bands}
# First identify the min and max age of participants 
enigma_demo %>% summarize(min_age = min(Age), max_age = max(Age), mean_age = mean(Age), median_age = median(Age), sd_age = sd(Age))
# for Age: min = 11.2, max = 25.27, mean = 18.47, median = 18.01, sd = 3.78
# Reference dplyr summarise() function - https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html

# Create a new variable that assigns an age band grouping based on Age
# age bands: 11-14, 15-17, 18-21, 21+
enigma_age_bands <- enigma_BAG %>%
  # use the mutate function to create a new column ('age_band') based on values in existing column ('Age')
  mutate(age_band = case_when(
    # use case_when function to define what string to assign when conditions are met 
    Age >= 11 & Age < 15 ~ "11-14", 
    Age >= 15 & Age < 18 ~ "15-17",
    Age >= 18 & Age <= 21 ~ "18-21",
    Age > 21 ~ "21+",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
    # if any row does not meet the assigned condition (e.g., age is not reported), assign NA value
  ))
 # set upper limit to be < 15 and < 18 so that any participants w/ age above 14 or 17 but younger than 15 or 18 (14 w/ decimal places, 17 w/ decimal places) will still be assigned an age band rather than NA
enigma_age_bands
  
```

## Create total disorder categories
```{r Creating a new variable for total # disorders}
# First identify the min and max total # of disorders 
enigma_BAG %>% summarize(min_disorders = min(total_dx), max_disorders = max(total_dx), mean_disorders = mean(total_dx), median_disorders = median(total_dx), sd_disorders = sd(total_dx))
# for total number of disorders: min = 0, max = 8, mean = 3.40, median = 3, sd = 1.54

# Create a new variable that assigns an grouping for total number of disorders based on 'total_dx'
# append this new column to data frame that contains age bands
# total number of disorders categories: 0-1, 2-3, 4+
enigma_new <- enigma_age_bands %>%
  # use the mutate function to create a new column ('age_band') based on values in existing column ('Age')
  mutate(total_dx_group = case_when(
    total_dx >= 0 & total_dx < 2 ~ "0-1", 
    total_dx >= 2 & total_dx < 4 ~ "2-3",
    total_dx >= 4 ~ "4+",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))
 # set upper limit to be inclusive of 4 unlike age bands
enigma_new

# try a different grouping scheme for total # disorders
enigma_new <- enigma_age_bands %>%
  mutate(total_dx_group = case_when(
    total_dx >= 0 & total_dx < 3 ~ "0-2", 
    total_dx >= 3 & total_dx < 5 ~ "3-4",
    total_dx >= 5 ~ "5+",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))
enigma_new

# Determine how many participants fall into the total disorder groups
enigma_new %>% count(total_dx_group)
# using the first grouping scheme: 0-1 (n=27), 2-3 (n=139), 4+ (n=133)
# using the second grouping scheme: 0-2 (n=86), 3-4 (n=145), 5+ (n=68)

# rearrange column order to make viewing the data frame more intuitive
# participant, sex, dx, total_dx, total_dx_group, age_band, Age, age_prediction, BAG
enigma_new <- select(enigma_new, participant, sex, dx, total_dx, total_dx_group, age_band, Age, age_prediction, BAG)

```
## Save the modified enigma df as csv
```{r Write edited data frame to csv}
# save the modified enigma data frame with age bands and total disorder groupings 
write.csv(enigma_new, "/KIMEL/tigrlab/scratch/csun/brainage_proj/data/processed/enigma_new.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Data visualization

# the average brain age gap is significantly greater in males compared to females 

# ASD: Yes or No 
t.test(BAG ~ ASD_dx, alternative = "two.sided", data = enigma_ASD)
# There is no significant difference between the brain age gap of individuals with ASD compared to those without ASD (p=2.022).

#### sex and age ####
# scan age and sex
t.test(Age ~ sex, alternative = "two.sided", data = enigma_new)
# the average age at which participants were scanned is not statistically different between males and females (female: 18.55, male: 18.28, p = 0.5884)

# predicted age and sex
t.test(age_prediction ~ sex, alternative = "two.sided", data = enigma_new)
# the average predicted brain age is significantly greater for males (21.87) than females (18.55), p=0.002634

# age and dx (PSS vs Non-PSS)
t.test(Age ~ dx, alternative = "two.sided", data = enigma_new)
